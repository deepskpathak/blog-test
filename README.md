# whyable-blog-test
#####A simple blog with react components

[Hosted Demo](http://www.deepakpathak.in/whyable)

### Technologies used
1. [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - for components
2. [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - for production deployment
3. [Sentry](https://app.getsentry.com) - for debugging and unit testing React DOM in dev and production

### Points for evaluator
1. The data file is created by myself, and it is not a perfect real world way to show this kind of data. Consider it a junk set of data just for purpose.
2. Any REST based data can be used. 
3. Primary focus is on reusability of HTML+JS in form of react components. 
4. Few things can be done in many better ways but for this small test I have used least complicated way. Routing can be used and there can be many kinds of states which can be handled in real applications.
5. Testing React DOM in form checkboxes wasn't very clear, natural, or initutative , so used Sentry. 
6. Ideal way is to write unit test in Jest/Mocha etc. 
7. The same can be achieved in AngularJS , Polymer or any other library/framework. Choice of react was based upon its focus on declarative 'Views'
8. To run locally - 
download or clone the repository , then 
```
npm install
npm run start
```
If building for production -
```
npm run production
```

##### PS: I am sorry for the cat pictures! I just find them curious and interested.
